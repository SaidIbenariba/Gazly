## Introduction
Welcome to the showcase of our latest project aimed at building a comprehensive website for laboratories to organize their information and monitor for toxic gas leaks. This README provides an overview of the project's objectives, features, and technologies utilized.

## Project Overview
Our goal with this project was to develop a user-friendly platform where laboratories can efficiently organize their data and stay informed about potential toxic gas leaks. The website offers features for data management, monitoring, and collaboration, ensuring laboratory safety and compliance with regulations.

## Objectives
Create a centralized platform for laboratories to manage their information effectively.
Implement a monitoring system to detect and alert users about toxic gas leaks.
Provide intuitive data visualization tools for easy analysis.
Facilitate collaboration among laboratory staff for better communication and response to safety incidents.
Ensure compliance with safety regulations and standards.
## Features
### Dashboard:
Overview of recent activities, alerts, and important notifications.
Quick access to key functionalities and data summaries.
### Data Management:
Tools for organizing laboratory information, including equipment inventory, experiment logs, and safety protocols.
Customizable forms for inputting and updating data.
### Toxic Gas Monitoring:
Integration with gas sensors and detectors to monitor for toxic gas leaks in real-time.
Automated alerts via email or SMS in case of detected leaks.
Historical data tracking and analysis to identify trends and patterns.
### Data Visualization:
Interactive charts and graphs to visualize gas concentration levels over time.
Heatmaps to identify areas with high gas concentration or frequent leaks.
### Collaboration Tools:
Discussion forums and messaging features for laboratory staff to communicate and share information.
Task management and assignment tools for coordinating safety protocols and response plans.
### Compliance Tracking:
Tools to track regulatory compliance requirements and deadlines.
Reminders and notifications for upcoming inspections or safety audits.
User Authentication and Access Control:
Secure login system with role-based access control to ensure data privacy and confidentiality.
Different levels of access permissions for administrators, researchers, and technicians.
